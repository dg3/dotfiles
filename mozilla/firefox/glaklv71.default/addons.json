It has been specially designed for Windows 7 (with Aero Style enabled), but it can also be installed on other Windows versions and Linux (just be aware that some things may look different due to differences between platforms). It does NOT officially support Aurora/Firefox Developer Edition and Nightly. It is not officially available for MAC, but for those who would like to try it anyway on that platform, you can force download (regardless if it is the Windows or the Linux file) and once the package downloaded on your computer, you can install it manually by clicking the \"tools\" button in the add-ons manager and then selecting \"install an add-on from file...\".\nIt contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available here\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\" which you'll find here\n\n• FT DEEPDARK 12beta11 available HERE FOR DOWNLOAD\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH FT DEEPDARK ?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue as you can easily notice, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on my themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.

Whether you do intensive research, or just browse around and like to be fast and dynamic, FindBar Tweak will definitely enhance your experience with Firefox!\n\nAll find features are fully compatible with pdf documents, opened through the Firefox PDF.JS native reader or the PDF Viewer extension; Adobe Reader isn't supported.\n\nMain features:\n- Move Findbar to the top of the window, it will be displayed above the webpage, either on the left or on the right (like Google Chrome)\n\n- Override the default per-tab Findbar behavior with:\n-- Close the findbar when clicking somewhere in the webpage (when it loses focus)\n-- Use a single global Findbar for all tabs in the window\n-- Remember the Findbar's opened/closed state on startup\n\n- Ctrl+F (Command+F on Mac) toggles the FindBar (close it too)\n-- Optionally only close it if the FindBar already has focus; otherwise it will move focus to the FindBar instead of closing it, and will fill it with the selected text again (if that preference is enabled)\n\n- Hide Findbar close button and replace the Findbar's button labels with icons\n\n- Resize the find text field by dragging its border (right border when the Findbar is on the left, left border when the Findbar is on the right)\n-- Double-click on the border to immediately resize to the maximum/minimum width possible.\n\n- Enable/Disable QuickFind so you can search for text immediately by typing anywhere in the webpage\n-- Show buttons in QuickFindbar\n-- Set QuickFindbar auto-close timeout\n-- Option to always open the QuickFind bar through the keyboard shortcut or the toolbar button\n\n- Total matches found counter and current match indicator in the findbar\n-- The add-on uses a completely different implementation from the browser's own match counter, to better integrate with the rest of its highlights features.\n\nHighlights tweaks:\n- 'Highlight all' by default (?)\n- Hit Esc on a page to remove its highlights\n- Also highlight on 'Find Again' - F3 or clicking the Next or Previous buttons (?)\n- Delay the highlights if the search term is shorter than a defined number of characters (default is 3) to improve performance\n- Change the highlights color and the current search hit color\n-- It's recommended to keep the default contrast color for the current search hit, as to not interfere with normal text selection colors, which are based on your current operating system settings. If you uncheck this box, the contrast color will be automatically calculated based on your color choice (black for light colors, white for dark colors) and it will also be applied to normal text selection.\n\nFind in All Tabs: find the current search term in all opened tabs\n- Click on an item to immediatelly focus that hit. If it is on another tab or window, it will be brought up automatically.\n- Finds also in View Source windows!\n- Filter results by finding only in a specific tab group, in pinned tabs or in view source windows.\n- Some punctuation may be a bit off in text strings with mixed direction (both left-to-right and right-to-left).\n- Quickly open/update the lists by hitting Alt+F3 (Option+F3 on Mac)\n- Find in All Tabs is not accessible through the Quickfind bar.\n\nFocus Sights on the current search hit\n- Easily lets you know where in the page is the current search hit\n- \"Sights on All Highlights\" will place focus sights on all highlighted hits as you scroll the page\n-- Use \"Sights on All Highlights\" with caution! With a large amount of highlights, rendering sights on all of them can be very resource intensive and page scrolling can become slow!\n\nHighlights grid in the scrollbar\n- If highlights are found in frames or editable elements (like the google search box), the frames or editable elements themselves will be shown in the grid with a distinct pattern; with frames, the actual highlights will appear in a grid in the scrollbar of the frame they are in.\n- The position and size of the grid can be adjusted in the preferences dialog; positive values mean the grid will be larger and further away from the window border, negative values mean it will be thinner and closer to the margin.\n- In pdf documents, matches will initially show up with a pattern in the grid, representing the pages they're in rather than the matches themselves. This is because PDF.JS renders the pages as they are shown on screen. As the page is scrolled (and the matches are physically rendered) the grid will be updated accordingly.\n- If the opened tab is the selected tab in the Find in All Tabs lists, when moving the mouse over a search hit item, the grid will show the position of that hit as well.\n\nA note about the placement of the highlights in the grid relatively to the position of the scrollbar: For increasingly long pages the highlights placement corresponds less and less to the position of the scrollbar. It's mathematically impossible to place a line in the grid and fix it to a position that corresponds exactly to the position of the scrollbar when you need to scroll the page some 2000 lines to move the scrollbar by one pixel.\n\nSo for long pages, don't think of the grid as a place of \"reference to where you should move the scrollbar\" but rather as a place that shows where the highlights are in the webpage.\n\nOther tweaks:\n- Set whether opening the findbar fills it with the selected text or not\n- Selecting text on a webpage immediately copies the selected text to the findbar and searches for it\n-- When used together with \"Highlight all by default\", it will highlight all matches of the selected text, even if the findbar is closed.\n-- Show the QuickFind bar (it will open in normal mode if \"Always use normal Findbar\" is enabled) when using selected text.\n\nThe add-on should handle all firefox native preferences automatically, by reverting any changes made to these when the add-on is disabled or removed. However, if you experience some error and those changes are not reverted, for example the highlights color remains changed after you disable the add-on, you can always reset all changed native preferences from within the preferences dialog.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/116/116848.png?src=api&modified=1435569092","width":"700","height":"391","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/116/116848.png?src=api&modified=1435569092","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"112","caption":"All of Findbar Tweaks major features can be seen here, including moving it to the top of the browser, the highlights grid, the counter and a focus sights on the current hit."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/160/160486.png?src=api&modified=1435569092","width":"700","height":"377","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/160/160486.png?src=api&modified=1435569092","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"108","caption":"The Find in All Tabs dialog in action.
